# AWS Secure VPC - Terraform Project

This project builds a secure AWS VPC using Terraform as part of my cloud security learning path.


It includes:

- A dedicated VPC
- Public and private subnets
- Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway
- Route tables and security groups
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Encrypted S3 bucket for logs
- GuardDuty for threat detection (configured in AWS)

All infrastructure changes are defined as code using Terraform.
